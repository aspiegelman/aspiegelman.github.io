<h{"path":"/Applications/Brackets.app/Contents/samples/root/Getting Started/index.html"}1>HOW TO EAT GLUTEN FREE IN MADISON</h1>
<h2><u>Welcome to my homepage!</u></h2>
<h3>All you need to know about living a gluten free lifestyle as a college student in Madison, Wisconsin!</h3>
<p><strong>My background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am from Long Island, New York. I live in a town called Roslyn which is about 40 minutes outside of New York City.</li>
<li>In 2016, I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease. Since then, I have been on a journey to create gluten free recipes and find the best gluten free restaurants around. I am currently a sophomore at UW Madison. Navigating around Madison to find gluten free food was a challenge at first, but after much exploring, I have adjusted to this city and I am here to share everything I have learned with you!</li>
</ul>
